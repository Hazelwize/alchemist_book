## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This site created using a public API for fetching the recipes, title, and photo of drinks in the category that you type into the search bar. You can then hit the 'next' or 'previous' button to navigate through all of the recipes that you can make with that type of alcohol. 

## Optimizations

This was just a quick little project, but if I had more time to spend on it, I would let the user save drinks to a list. If I didn't want to make a whole CRUD app, I could just use local storage to keep a running list of favorites. 

## Lessons Learned:

With this project, I was able to get more comfortable with data manipulation and making fetch requests to APIs. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
